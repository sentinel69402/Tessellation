# Tessellation
Tessellation is a lightweight, high-performance animation **kernel** for Roblox, designed to handle large numbers of animations reliably by enforcing **state coherence** and providing **intelligent conflict resolution** . It streamlines loading, caching, and playback while providing robust debugging, grouping, and advanced playback control.

This kernel abstracts animation track management, automatically handles character respawn, and integrates seamlessly into existing systems.
